A 1-2 player cooperative game best described as a blend of Rampage, Bomberman, and Crypt of the NecroDancer, created by [Bitterly Indifferent Studios](https://bitterlyindifferent.itch.io/) for [OST Jam Volume 2](https://itch.io/jam/ost-jam-vol-2), featuring music by [inkedsplat](https://twitter.com/inkedsplat). It was built using [@morgan3d](https://github.com/morgan3d)'s [quadplay✜](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) virtual console, and should be playable on any device with a reasonably modern web browser.
